# Access Control

- Review file permissions
    - Ensure users only have access to specific files
        - Do you need a low-privilege user reading contents in an admin's desktop?

- UAC prompts
    - Ensure some form of UAC prompting is enabled on the computer
    - Strictness can vary

- Drive sharing
    - Poses major security risks
    - Turn off drive sharing if not critical
